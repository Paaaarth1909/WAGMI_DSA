/* You are given the head of a singly linked list. You have to determine whether the given linked list contains a loop or not. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Examples:

Input: pos = 2,
   
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the second node.
Input: pos = 0,
   
Output: false
Explanation: There exists no loop in given linked list.
Input: pos = 1,
   
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the first node.
Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 103       
0 ≤ pos ≤ number of nodes
