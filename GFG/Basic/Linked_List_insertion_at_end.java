/* You are given the head of a Singly Linked List and a value x, insert that value x at the end of the LinkedList and return the head of the modified Linked List.

Examples :

Input: x = 6,
   
Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
Explanation: We can see that 6 is inserted at the end of the linkedlist.
   
Input: x = 1,
   
Output: 4 -> 5 -> 1
Explanation: We can see that 1 is inserted at the end of the linked list.
      
Constraints:
0 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 105
0 ≤ node->data , x ≤ 103
