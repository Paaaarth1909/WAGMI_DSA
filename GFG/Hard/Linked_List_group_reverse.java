/* You are given the head of a Singly linked list. You have to reverse every k node in the linked list and return the head of the modified list.
Note: If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then the left-out nodes at the end, should be considered as a group and must be reversed.

Examples:

Input: k = 2,
   

Output: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 5
Explanation: Linked List is reversed in a group of size k = 2.


Input: k = 4,   

Output: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5
Explanation: Linked List is reversed in a group of size k = 4.


Constraints:
1 ≤ size of linked list ≤ 105
0 ≤ node->data ≤ 106
1 ≤ k ≤ size of linked list
